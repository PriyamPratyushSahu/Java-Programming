Bit manipulation is an essential concept in computer programming,
especially in low-level operations, embedded systems, and optimizing algorithms. 

Program list:

1. _01_Bit_Manipulation_Fundamentals : List of all bit manipulation techniques
2. _02_Prog1: You are given an array of size 2n+1, which contains n+1 distinct values, where n values are repeated twice but that 1 distinct value
 is present once. Find that value use Bit manipulation technique
