Bit manipulation is an essential concept in computer programming,
especially in low-level operations, embedded systems, and optimizing algorithms. 

Program list:

1. _01_Bit_Manipulation_Fundamentals : List of all bit manipulation techniques

************* XOR based Programs ***********************
2. _02_Prog1 : You are given an array of size 2n+1, which contains n+1 distinct values, where n values are repeated twice but that 1 distinct value
 is present once. Find that value use Bit manipulation technique
3. _03_Prog2 : Write a program to swap two numbers without using 3rd variable 
4. _04_Prog3 : Write a program to print XOR value of given n, starting from 1 to n, with time complexity O(1)
5. _05_Prog4 : For a given range(L to R) Find the XOR between L to R, which is L ^ (L+1) ^ (L+2) ^ ... (R-1) ^ R
