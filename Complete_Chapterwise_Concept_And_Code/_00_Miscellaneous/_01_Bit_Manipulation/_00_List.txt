Bit manipulation is an essential concept in computer programming,
especially in low-level operations, embedded systems, and optimizing algorithms. 

Program list:

1. _01_Bit_Manipulation_Fundamentals : List of all bit manipulation techniques

************* XOR(^) operator based Programs ***********************

2. _02_Prog : You are given an array of size 2n+1, which contains n+1 distinct values, where n values are repeated twice but that 1 distinct value
    is present once. Find that value use Bit manipulation technique
3. _03_Prog : Write a program to swap two numbers without using 3rd variable 
4. _04_Prog : Write a program to print XOR value of given n, starting from 1 to n, with time complexity O(1)
5. _05_Prog : For a given range(L to R) Find the XOR between L to R, which is L ^ (L+1) ^ (L+2) ^ ... (R-1) ^ R

************* XOR(^) operator based Programs ***********************

************* AND(&) operator based Programs ***********************

6. _06_Prog : Write a program to check a number is even or odd, using Bit Manipulation
7. _07_Prog : Write a  program to Count Set Bits (Hamming Weight): Count the number of 1 bits in an integer
8. _08_Prog : Write a  program to check if a Number is a Power of Two: Determine if a given integer is a power of 2

************* AND(&) operator based Programs ***********************

9. _09_Prog : Check if the ith location of the number is a set or not(1 or not)
10._10_Prog : A menu driven program
    1. Get the Nth Bit: Get the value of the Nth bit (0 or 1) from an integer
    2. Set the Nth Bit: Set (make it 1) the Nth bit of an integer
    3. Clear the Nth Bit: Clear (make it 0) the Nth bit of an integer.
    4. Update the Nth Bit: Update (set to a specific value) the Nth bit of an integer.
    5. Extract Lowest Set Bit: Get the value of the lowest set (1) bit in an integer.
